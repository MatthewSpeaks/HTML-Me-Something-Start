                  Turtle is a defensive position you can get to in several ways. Common scenerios would be off of a failed take down attempt or rolling over from the bottom position as a last resort to prevent a guard pass. The top players main objective is to prevent the bottom player recovering from the turtle position by maintaining pressure, attacking and establishing grips between the elbow and knee of bottom player or threatening chokes, like a guilliotine. Top player is looking to roll the bottom player into side control, back control, or mount. The bottom player is looking to escape to their feet when possible. The best way to do this is to prevent underhooks and seek a pancake guard grip to perform a technical stand up. The other option is to reestablish a guard.
