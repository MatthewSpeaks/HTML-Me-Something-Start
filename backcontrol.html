                The back control position, or back/rear mount is one of the most sought after positions in BJJ and arguably provides the greatest amount of control of your opponent. Maintaining multiple points of contact and chest to back connection is key to maintaining the position. One arm is wrapped underneath the arm of the opponent and across the chest, called the "seatbelt", while the other arm established over the shoulder and across the neck, the "choke" arm. Both legs are occupying the space between the elbow and knee of your opponent and heels are dug in wrapped around the thigh and hip of the opponent in what is known as "hooks". There are many different types of chokes to pursue from this position, including the infamous "Rear Naked Choke". There is a lot of grip fighting taking place back and forth while the bottom player is using 2 on 1 techniques to remove hooks, prevent chokes, and break away from chest to back connection.
