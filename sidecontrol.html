            <h3>Position Description</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Top player has established control between the elbow and knee, to one side of the bottom player.</li>
               <li>A combination of A far side underhook, cross face, and chest to chest pressure are used to secure the position.</li>
               <li>Top player keeps their knees tight to the bottom players hip and armpit to prevent the bottom polayer from establishing frames or a reguard.</li>

               <p>
                  This position is common to establish after a successful guard pass. Top player can now work towards setting up desired submission positons such as mount or back control (rear mount). This is a scoring position for the top player and it is good to take your time to setup a transition to mroe advantageous position or even secure a submission from side control. Popular submissions from side control include the Kumora, Americana, or the Head and Arm choke. If you lose your underhook and need to re-establish, knee on belly can be advantageous. The bottom player is often looking to stop the advance of the top player, secure a reguard, or even escape back to turtle.
