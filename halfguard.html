            <h3>Position Description</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Bottom player has top player in front of one leg.</li>
               <li>Thighs are clamped tightly on one leg to maintain the position</li>
               <li>Hand grips and or frames are established to prevent a guard pass.</li>

            </div>
               <p>
                   The half guard is a neutral position. The bottom player is typically looking to establish a knee shield to create distance and setup common sweeping positions like the dogfight. THe top player is typically looking to flatten their opponent to setup their guard pass. The top player can go for many guard passes, including the smash pass, kumora pass, leg weave, knee cut, or others. There are even possible submission opportunities for the top player from half guard, including the kumora or head and arm choke, but these would be difficult.
